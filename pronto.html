                            <p><i class="small">Winner of the Best Overall Award and the Audience Favorite Award</i><br/><br/><b>Problem Statement</b><br/> Small businesses are the backbone of U.S. economy – over 50% of the population works for SMB and 500k SMBs are started each month. Yet, SMBs face unique challenges on their path to success, on how to succeed in a new market, or compete against much larger incumbents. We hacked together a working prototype of an application or mobile application that will help small business owners. <br/><br/> <b>Value Proposition</b><br/> Helping local small businesses manage their excess inventory by connecting them with customers. <br><br> 
<b>A Common Complaint Emerged</b><br/> We visited local stores, watched customers at the stores, and interviewed store owners. We wanted to understand their life, environment, behaviors, what problems do they have and what hacks they use to solve these problems. We heard that business owners often had wasted excess inventory at the end of the day or they would have downtime with no customers. One of our team members even saw a cupcake store owner dump leftover food at the end of the day. We wanted to help SMBs such as food shops and hair salons take care of this problem. <br><br> 
<b>Designing for Simplicity</b><br/><br/> <img src="img/portfolio/pronto1.jpg" class="img-responsive col-sm-6" alt=""> <img src="img/portfolio/pronto2.jpg" class="img-responsive col-sm-6" alt="">
We started off with an auction model. However, after talking about this idea with our hackathon mentor and seeing him struggle to comprehend the business model, it dawned on us that this would be too complicated for a SMB to quickly grasp and use. This prompted our team to change our design to be a much more simplified purchasing model for each timeslot. <br><br> 
<b>Our Main Goals</b><br/> Create a channel to get rid of the excess inventory as well as to get new customers into their store. <br>Connect local SMBs and customers via this channel. <br>Make the channel less intrusive and simple. <br><br>

<b>Design Decisions</b><br/> We designed Pronto such that users who downloaded the app would only receive one offer, called a “Pronto”, every hour, on the hour for a place within 20 minutes walking distance. Once they received the offer, they had only 60 minutes to redeem the offer. We wanted to build both anticipation as well as the fear of missing out for each offer. <br><br>
For the Business app, users would see a timeslot that has expired, prompting a reactionary desire to purchase the next timeslot. The next timeslot shows a time to expiration and remaining coupons (or 'prontos'). The business owners can only purchase for the next two hours, which focuses them on an immediate purchase, and reduces additional contemplation or analysis. After he/she has chosen a timeslot, the screen then prompts them to adjust how many 'prontos' to send out to consumers with the app. The price of these deals is displayed as a round number to reduce complexity. <br><br>
<b>What I Did</b><br/>
                            Learned & developed an Android app in 4 hours! <br> Designed the Business end of the app. <br>Developed the mapping features on the Customer end of the app. <br/><br/></p>
