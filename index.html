                            <p><b>Problem Statement:</b> Navigation applications in the market that have been designed for the visually impaired rely prominently on smartphones, GPS and audio interfaces to speak out turn-by-turn walking directions for the user. These applications do not however address the learning curve of the user, and merely give sequential directions without the context of the surrounding environment. <br><br>Here's our personas for WayFinder users.<img src="img/portfolio/213-ci.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""><br>Affinity Diagramming!<img src="img/portfolio/213-wb.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">What surfaced was a need for location awareness: beyond cues affirming that users are on the right path, there is a need to be aware of locations that are familiar to them when navigating around new environments. Another concern was the lack of agency and fear of dependence on devices. <br><br>The observations that helped us<img src="img/portfolio/213-obs.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""><br> Showed us just how large our initial problem statement was. At this point the group decided to focus on the learning curve involved when blind and visually impaired users learned new paths, and how wearable technology could play a role in accelerating this process.<br><br>Here, have a meme.<img src="img/portfolio/213-pivot.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <br>“When people design, they create physical representations of their concepts.” - Beyer and Holtzblatt, Contextual Design <br><br>Low Fidelity Prototyping <img src="img/portfolio/213-axes.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""><br>App Screenshots [Developed using WearScript]</p>

                            <p><b>What is The Gadfly Project?</b> <br/><br/> The Gadfly Project is an automatic question generation service. If you input text, it outputs questions. This was the result of questions we have attempted to answer over the last several months in cycles of research and design. <br/>Here's a handy poster I designed to explain: <img src="img/portfolio/tgp.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> Our initial hypothesis was that our service could be used as comment-CAPTCHA. If you want to comment on an article, you will be asked a question generated by our service to prove that you actually read the article. So, we interviewed three local newspaper publishers (Berkeleyside, SFGate, Daily Cal) and the CEO of Disqus, a comment moderation provider, to better understand the online commenting space. <br/><br/> We used a survey to understand people's news reading and online commenting behavior. Within 10 days, we received 181 responses with an 82% completion rate! The survey’s most important finding was that 77% of the respondents preferred to answer a question instead of creating an account to leave a comment. We decided to conduct interviews with some of these respondents to learn more. <br/><br/> Apart from contributing to the user research, I defined the product vision for us by writing down what I imagined The Gadfly Project could be. This helped our team communicate in more concrete terms. <br/> You can read it <a href="https://medium.com/@n1khl/the-gadfly-project-19a901bd5abe" target="_blank">here</a> <br/><br/> At this point in the project, we needed a way to quickly get feedback from people about the questions being generated by the API. The I School Slack provided us easy access to several users and allowed us to quickly gather feedback and iterate. I designed and developed 2 different Slack Bots -- QBot (uses our API to quiz users on the news) and TriviaBot (conducts small trivia games using our API). They essentially interfaces that allow users to converse with our API in a controlled manner. We used them for testing the usability of our API. Below you can see an example interaction a user can have with QBot. <br/><img src="img/portfolio/bot1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <br/> This is a screenshot of an actual trivia session we organized during our live demo! <br/><img src="img/portfolio/bot2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> QBot and TriviaBot are good examples of what a curious developer can build using our API. If you have an ischool.berkeley.edu email address, you can join ischool.slack.com and try out our bots there! <br/><br/> Our focus in the future is improving the API and building out a platform that can enable other developers to explore the potential of question generation. <br/><br/><img src="img/portfolio/bot3.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <br/>

                            <p> <b> Problem: </b> There are no trustworthy platforms for members of academic communities to share their knowledge within their communities and outside the community. <br/><br/> <b> Our Value Proposition: Helping communities share and grow their knowledge.</b> <br/><br/> We want to create a primary medium to ask questions of a private academic community such as the I School and get answers you can trust. <br/><br/> So, we built a private Q&A tool where people can ask questions to trusted communities, privately or publicly. Right now, we have 106 users (including incoming students, current students, alumni and admin staff) engaging with the website. <br/><br/> <img src="img/portfolio/yckl4.png" class="img-responsive img-centered img-border" alt=""> The sign up page that uses LinkedIn OAuth. After usability testing, we added copy to inform users why we require them to log in using LinkedIn and what we do with their data. <br/><br/> <img src="img/portfolio/yckl.png" class="img-responsive img-centered img-border" alt=""> The main view is different questions asked by community members. The main UI elements are highlighted. <br/><br/> <img src="img/portfolio/yckl1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered img-border" alt=""> When a user clicks on a question, they see the individual question and answers. The interface elements maintain familiarity with the previous page. <br/><br/> <img src="img/portfolio/yckl2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered img-border" alt=""> The user can add their own answer here. We added a small line (the "no edit hack" above) to promote more mindfulness while answering. <br/><br/> <img src="img/portfolio/yckl3.png" class="img-responsive img-centered img-border" alt=""> If a user clicks on the ask button on the home page they see this screen. We kept this page very simple to avoid distractions. <br/><br/> I carried out user research (interviews, usability testing, card sort) to identify short term fixes and long term improvements. <br/><br/> Insights from the research have helped us prioritize the items on our roadmap. Eg. We want to Improve Discovery [by providing Search or other Discovery mechanism], Improve Engagement [using Notifications, Feeds], allow users to target questions at subject matter experts. For the long term product strategy, we want to drive wider adoption [through a Slack integration] and scale the system to handle several communities. <br/><br/> If you are a member of the Berkeley I School community, I would encourage you sign up at <a href="http://yackle.co" target="_blank">Yackle</a> and give us feedback. <br/><br/>

                            <p><br>In the Summer of 2015, I was a Design Intern at Amazon. I was assigned to the Kindle Content Design team and was tasked with studying and redesigning the Kindle Unlimited web experience. <br/><br/> I performed <strong>competitive analysis</strong> on Scribd & Oyster, carried out <strong>remote usability testing</strong>, extracted actionable insights using <strong>affinity diagramming</strong>, and then worked on <strong>low fidelity wireframes</strong> and <strong>high fidelity prototypes</strong>. I created and pitched a research plan for remote usability testing. The main goal of the proposal was to find discoverability issues on Kindle Unlimited in the first part of my internship. The tests were approximately one-hour remote interactions with customers where I asked them to carry out tasks and observed their interactions within the existing framework. I also looked at assessing what people actually like about the experience too. <br><br> Apart from the stated goals, I went beyond expectations and identified short term fixes that could be fixed easily. I built a case for each recommendation using quantitative data from Amazon's internal web analytics & A/B testing platform. I also observed other areas of the experience like search, wishlist and new content discovery. I worked with the product manager to convert my insights for the Kindle Store including a suggestion for a new feature. These recommendations were for the long term and they would have involved internal and external integrations. <br><br> Finally, I designed explorations for the Kindle Unlimited storefront.<br>Unfortunately, I can't share any of the designs online.</p>

I have been a Twitter user for 7 years now and really love using it. So, I would be perplexed when I met people who said "Oh I don't really know how to use Twitter" or "There's just so much happening on Twitter that I can't keep up." <br/><strong>I wanted to create something that would show me what I missed when I went away from Twitter.</strong> <br/> One of our testers remarked, "This is actually making me want to log in to my twitter account more!"<br/><br/> Try out the app here: <a href="http://tweetday.co"> tweetday.co</a><br/><br/></p>

                            <p>I worked on the TreeMap-style grid for displaying tweets. Users can choose to sort either by retweets or favorites and filter based on the kind of multimedia. More screenshots below: <br/><br/></p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/tweethover.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <h4>Approach:</h4><p><strong>In order to verify our hypothesis, we interviewed a diverse range of people and found that even self-identified "savvy" respondents were frustrated with the amount of information that they had to deal with.<br/></strong> After we validated the key pain points, our research turned to academic papers for inspiration. We based our designs on two academic visualizations we learned about in class -- Seesoft and TwitArcs. We found financial websites using TreeMaps to display a broad range of varied information daily. These combined helped us to display a large amount of tweets in a limited space. It also allowed the user to take control of their timeline and filter based on retweets, favorites, or media type (picture/video).<br/><br/>Using TwitArcs we show replies between different users. By following these arcs, users can trace connections between tweets and identify common themes if any. You can see me talking to Ryan Hoover (founder of Product Hunt) about Groundhog Day below!<br/><br/></p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/twitarchover.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>Using Seesoft we could present a vaste amount of text (about 2000 tweet worth!) in a single area on the left. Each thin row represented a tweet and on hover the text of the tweet is displayed in a modal panel. In the screenshot below, I dragged the ends of the scale to see only tweets from a certain period.<br/><br/></p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/seesoft.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>You can filter to see just images or videos if you wish.</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/onlyimages.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>We had great <strong>reactions from our users:</strong>
                                <br/>"This is definitely something that I would want to use."<br/>"I don’t think anything like this exists and I would like to use it when it comes out."<br/><br/>
                                Overall, I felt like we had delivered on what we set out to make. But I don't think we solved all that we thought we would solve. Some of the issues that we can fix are introducing an onboarding process so that users can familiarize themselves with the different elements. Also, as the contact area is so small, users have to hover very precisely over each element in the block to see the individual tweets. Twitter has no trouble retaining me, a power user, but it can be confusing and it can even be repellent for new users. This does not quite solve that problem. It does provide a different way for existing users (who are struggling with the information overload) to keep in touch.
                                However, I definitely think the TweetDay experience can be bettered as we work on known issues and continue to iterate on the designs going forward.<br/><br/></p>

                            <p>Clover is a community oriented video game that aims to reduce social anxiety while waiting, and promote cooperative social interactions between members.<br/><br/>. We had to build something for a community and the one we chose was the dinner line that forms in Cloyne Court, the student housing cooperative—the biggest in the US—located at on the north side of the UC Berkeley campus. Here's a video of the game being played by some members of Cloyne Court. <br/><br/> One of my team mates used to live in Cloyne so we knew that students had issues with the dinner line. We did participant observations at dinner time for three days and also interviewed residents while they waited to find out more. <br/> The key findings from the interview were that members often had to get in line early because if they don't they might not get any food at all. Quite a few students mentioned that they feel the line has become uncooperative over the semesters. <br/><br/> One of our team mates was really good at game design so we were happy to leverage here expertise and make a collaborative game. Here are some of the ideas we sketched during our brainstorming. <img src="img/portfolio/cloversketches.png" class="img-responsive img-centered img-border" alt=""> We borrowed bowls from the Cloyne dinner hall and taped our laser-cut buttons on the top. Each bowl contained a raspberry pi to transmit user input (pressing the button) over WiFi to our Node.js server. <img src="img/portfolio/bowls.png" class="img-responsive img-centered img-border" alt=""> The player has to press a button to make the chameleon change its color to the color of the leaf coming up. The challenge is that there are just 3 buttons: red, blue and yellow. So, player has to coordinate with other players to match the secondary colors. For example, players need to press red and blue to match a green leaf. The resulting interaction is not just cooperative, but challenging and funny as you can be seen in this video where some of the members of the community are playing it: <br/><br/> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YioWTcfJsq0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br/><br/> Players loved the high score feature, enjoyed the bowl integration, and — get this — were even looking forward to the dinner line the next day. We also found out that there was delay due to the WiFi latency and unclear affordances. It took players a while to figure out that they need to match the color of the next, not current, leaf. <br/><br/> In the future in terms of design, we want to revisit controller design & form factors. The bowls were cumbersome and we found it hard to debug the hardware components inside. We also want to explore different feedback methods besides color change (such as music, walking speed). <br/><br/> You can try out the game (minus the cool buttons) at queuemeleon.herokuapp.com on a desktop browser.

                                <p><br>Twitch is a live streaming video platform that mainly focuses on video gaming, including esports broadcasts, playthroughs by users, and other gaming-related events. By February 2014, it was considered the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic in the United States. <br></p>

                                <p><br> The infographic below depicts Twitch’s growth from 2013 to date along with the position it occupies in the growing online video consumption space. I have also included a brief narrative of Twitch Plays Pokemon, a social experiment to play the Pokemon game series using commands input via chat. After 122 million commands, the players finally managed to finish the game. The narrative they generated has a collective mythology; a god, a savior, a devil, fallen warriors, those who were never given a chance, and hope for the future. <br> The narrative and the resulting discussion, in my opinion, is how the future of storytelling will be influenced by technology and cross-cultural collaboration. <br> <br> Since, the subject deals with video games, I used 8bit icons and typography. I also chose to demarcate the sections with “hand drawn” dotted lines. I added comic book style transition arrows for effect as well as maintaining a clear visual hierarchy. I also drew the Pokemon used and outlined them using Illustrator. <br><br>All praise Lord Helix! <br></p><img src="img/portfolio/helix.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""></p>

                            <p><b>Problem Statement:</b> Small businesses are the backbone of U.S. economy – over 50% of the population works for SMB and 500k SMBs are started each month, and the statistics are similar in other countries. Yet, SMBs face unique challenges on their path to success, on how to succeed in a new market, or compete against much larger incumbents. Hack together a working prototype of an application or mobile application that will help small business owners. <br> <b>Value Proposition:</b> Helping local small businesses manage their excess inventory by connecting them with customers. <br><br>We visited local stores (cupcake stores!), watched customers at the stores, and interviewed store owners. We wanted to understand their life, environment, behaviors, what problems do they have and what hacks they use to solve these problems. <br><br><br> A common complaint we heard was that business owners often had wasted excess inventory at the end of the day or they would have downtime with no customers. We wanted to help SMBs such as food shops and hair salons. We found enough insights and evidence to validate our idea. So what do we think is the solution? <br><br> We started off with an auction model. However, after talking about this idea with our mentor and seeing him struggle to comprehend the business model, it dawned on us that this would be too complicated for a SMB to quickly grasp and use. This prompted our team to change our design to be a much more simplified purchasing model for each timeslot. <br><br> Create a channel to get rid of the excess inventory as well as to get new customers into their store. <br>Connect local SMBs and customers via this channel. <br>Make the channel less intrusive and simple. <br><br><img src="img/portfolio/prontos.png" class="img-responsive col-sm-4" alt=""><img src="img/portfolio/pronto-c.png" class="img-responsive col-sm-4" alt=""><img src="img/portfolio/pronto-b.png" class="img-responsive col-sm-4" alt=""><br><br>We designed Pronto such that users who downloaded the app would only receive one offer, called a “Pronto”, every hour, on the hour for a place within 20 minutes walking distance. Once they received the offer, they had only 60 minutes to redeem the offer. We wanted to build both anticipation as well as the fear of missing out for each offer. <br><br>For the Business app, users would see a timeslot that has expired, prompting a reactionary desire to purchase the next timeslot. The next timeslot shows a time to expiration and remaining coupons (or 'prontos'). The business owners can only purchase for the next two hours, which focuses them on an immediate purchase, and reduces additional contemplation or analysis. After he/she has chosen a timeslot, the screen then prompts them to adjust how many 'prontos' to send out to consumers with the app. The price of these deals is displayed as a round number to reduce complexity. <br><br>
                            Learned Android in 4 hours! <br> Developed the Business end of the app. <br>Developed the mapping features on the Customer end of the app. <br>Won the Best Overall Prize and the Audience Prize. </p>
