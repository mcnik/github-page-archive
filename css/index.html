                            <p><b>Problem Statement:</b> Small businesses are the backbone of U.S. economy – over 50% of the population works for SMB and 500k SMBs are started each month, and the statistics are similar in other countries. Yet, SMBs face unique challenges on their path to success, on how to succeed in a new market, or compete against much larger incumbents. Hack together a working prototype of an application or mobile application that will help small business owners. <br> <b>Value Proposition:</b> Helping local small businesses manage their excess inventory by connecting them with customers. <br><br>We visited local stores (cupcake stores!), watched customers at the stores, and interviewed store owners. We wanted to understand their life, environment, behaviors, what problems do they have and what hacks they use to solve these problems. <br><br><br> A common complaint we heard was that business owners often had wasted excess inventory at the end of the day or they would have downtime with no customers. We wanted to help SMBs such as food shops and hair salons. We found enough insights and evidence to validate our idea. So what do we think is the solution? <br><br> We started off with an auction model. However, after talking about this idea with our mentor and seeing him struggle to comprehend the business model, it dawned on us that this would be too complicated for a SMB to quickly grasp and use. This prompted our team to change our design to be a much more simplified purchasing model for each timeslot. <br><br> Create a channel to get rid of the excess inventory as well as to get new customers into their store. <br>Connect local SMBs and customers via this channel. <br>Make the channel less intrusive and simple. <br><br><img src="img/portfolio/prontos.png" class="img-responsive col-sm-4" alt=""><img src="img/portfolio/pronto-c.png" class="img-responsive col-sm-4" alt=""><img src="img/portfolio/pronto-b.png" class="img-responsive col-sm-4" alt=""><br><br>We designed Pronto such that users who downloaded the app would only receive one offer, called a “Pronto”, every hour, on the hour for a place within 20 minutes walking distance. Once they received the offer, they had only 60 minutes to redeem the offer. We wanted to build both anticipation as well as the fear of missing out for each offer. <br><br>For the Business app, users would see a timeslot that has expired, prompting a reactionary desire to purchase the next timeslot. The next timeslot shows a time to expiration and remaining coupons (or 'prontos'). The business owners can only purchase for the next two hours, which focuses them on an immediate purchase, and reduces additional contemplation or analysis. After he/she has chosen a timeslot, the screen then prompts them to adjust how many 'prontos' to send out to consumers with the app. The price of these deals is displayed as a round number to reduce complexity. <br><br>
                            Learned Android in 4 hours! <br> Developed the Business end of the app. <br>Developed the mapping features on the Customer end of the app. <br>Won the Best Overall Prize and the Audience Prize. </p>

                                <p><br>Twitch is a live streaming video platform that mainly focuses on video gaming, including esports broadcasts, playthroughs by users, and other gaming-related events. By February 2014, it was considered the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic in the United States. <br></p>
<br> <img src="img/portfolio/infoviz.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
<p><br> The infographic below depicts Twitch’s growth from 2013 to date along with the position it occupies in the growing online video consumption space. I have also included a brief narrative of Twitch Plays Pokemon, a social experiment to play the Pokemon game series using commands input via chat. After 122 million commands, the players finally managed to finish the game. The narrative they generated has a collective mythology; a god, a savior, a devil, fallen warriors, those who were never given a chance, and hope for the future. <br> The narrative and the resulting discussion, in my opinion, is how the future of storytelling will be influenced by technology and cross-cultural collaboration. <br> <br> Since, the subject deals with video games, I used 8bit icons and typography. I also chose to demarcate the sections with “hand drawn” dotted lines. I added comic book style transition arrows for effect as well as maintaining a clear visual hierarchy. I also drew the Pokemon used and outlined them using Illustrator. <br><br>All praise Lord Helix! <br></p><img src="img/portfolio/helix.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""></p>

                            <p>In Case You Missed It. People and organizations use the acronym ICYMI to bring content to the attention of those who may have missed it before. I have been a Twitter user for 7 years now and really love using it. So, I would be perplexed when I met people who said "Oh I don't really know how to use Twitter" or "There's just so much happening on Twitter that I can't keep up." <br/><strong>I wanted to create something that would show me what I missed when I went away from Twitter.</strong> <br/> One of our testers remarked, "This is actually making me want to log in to my twitter account more!"<br/><br/> Try out the app here: <a href="http://tweetday.co"> tweetday.co</a><br/><br/>

<p>I worked on the TreeMap-style grid for displaying tweets. Users can choose to sort either by retweets or favorites and filter based on the kind of multimedia. More screenshots below: <br/><br/></p>

<h4>Approach:</h4><p><strong>In order to verify our hypothesis, we interviewed a diverse range of people and found that even self-identified "savvy" respondents were frustrated with the amount of information that they had to deal with.<br/></strong> After we validated the key pain points, our research turned to academic papers for inspiration. We based our designs on two academic visualizations we learned about in class -- Seesoft and TwitArcs. We found financial websites using TreeMaps to display a broad range of varied information daily. These combined helped us to display a large amount of tweets in a limited space. It also allowed the user to take control of their timeline and filter based on retweets, favorites, or media type (picture/video).<br/><br/>Using TwitArcs we show replies between different users. By following these arcs, users can trace connections between tweets and identify common themes if any. You can see me talking to Ryan Hoover (founder of Product Hunt) about Groundhog Day below!<br/><br/>

<p>Using Seesoft we could present a vaste amount of text (about 2000 tweet worth!) in a single area on the left. Each thin row represented a tweet and on hover the text of the tweet is displayed in a modal panel. In the screenshot below, I dragged the ends of the scale to see only tweets from a certain period.<br/><br/></p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/seesoft.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
<p>You can filter to see just images or videos if you wish.</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/onlyimages.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
<p>We had great <strong>reactions from our users:</strong>
<br/>"This is definitely something that I would want to use."<br/>
"I don’t think anything like this exists and I would like to use it when it comes out."<br/><br/>
Overall, I felt like we had delivered on what we set out to make. But I don't think we solved all that we thought we would solve. Some of the issues that we can fix are introducing an onboarding process so that users can familiarize themselves with the different elements. Also, as the contact area is so small, users have to hover very precisely over each element in the block to see the individual tweets. Twitter has no trouble retaining me, a power user, but it can be confusing and it can even be repellent for new users. This does not quite solve that problem. It does provide a different way for existing users (who are struggling with the information overload) to keep in touch.
However, I definitely think the TweetDay experience can be bettered as we work on known issues and continue to iterate on the designs going forward.<br/><br/>

                            <p><br>In the Summer of 2015, I was a Design Intern at Amazon. I was assigned to the Kindle Content Design team and was tasked with studying and redesigning the Kindle Unlimited web experience. <br/><br/> I performed <strong>competitive analysis</strong> on Scribd & Oyster, carried out <strong>remote usability testing</strong>, extracted actionable insights using <strong>affinity diagramming</strong>, and then worked on <strong>low fidelity wireframes</strong> and <strong>high fidelity prototypes</strong>. I created and pitched a research plan for remote usability testing. The main goal of the proposal was to find discoverability issues on Kindle Unlimited in the first part of my internship. The tests were approximately one-hour remote interactions with customers where I asked them to carry out tasks and observed their interactions within the existing framework. I also looked at assessing what people actually like about the experience too. <br><br> Apart from the stated goals, I went beyond expectations and identified short term fixes that could be fixed easily. I built a case for each recommendation using quantitative data from Amazon's internal web analytics & A/B testing platform. I also observed other areas of the experience like search, wishlist and new content discovery. I worked with the product manager to convert my insights for the Kindle Store including a suggestion for a new feature. These recommendations were for the long term and they would have involved internal and external integrations. <br><br> Finally, I designed explorations for the Kindle Unlimited storefront.<br>Unfortunately, I can't share any of the designs online.</p>
