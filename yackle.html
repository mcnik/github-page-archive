                            <p> <b> Problem </b><br/> There are no trustworthy platforms for members of academic communities to share their knowledge within their communities and outside the community. People at our school are using ill-equipped communication tools for knowledge management. As a result, they end up losing vital information and often seek answers for questions that have already been answered. <br/><br/> <b> What Is It? </b><br/>  We built a private Q&A tool where people can ask questions to trusted communities, privately or publicly. You can <a href="http://yackle.co" target="_blank">try it here.</strong></a> Right now, we have 106 users (including incoming students, current students, alumni and admin staff) engaging with the website. 106 might seem like a small number but the school itself has only roughly 150 people. Here's some social validation:<br/><br/> <img src="img/portfolio/yack.png" class="img-responsive img-centered img-border" alt=""> <br/><br/> 
                                <b> Inspiration </b><br/> We looked at popular online communities that had knowledge management features like Reddit, ProductHunt, Quora. However, most of these communities deal with public communities. As a result, the discussion is more general and often threading is necessary. In our case as we were looking at a small private community, we chose to present a simple question and answer view.<br/><br/>
                                <b> Understanding Users </b><br/> The initial research was carried out by the product manager through interviews with students and staff. We created two sample personas (1 student, 1 staff) and focused on one (student) for our first iteration.<br/><br/>
                                <img src="img/portfolio/yacklepersona.png"class="img-responsive img-centered img-border" alt=""> <br/>
                                <b> User Needs </b><br/> From the initial research the main user need identified was that: Users need assurance that the information they are getting is from a credible source. For this purpose, we designed 3 features. <br/><br/>
                                Welcome to Yackle.<br/><br/> <img src="img/portfolio/yckl4.png" class="img-responsive img-centered img-border" alt=""> <br/>
<b>Inside Look</b><br/>The sign up page uses LinkedIn OAuth. We wanted to tie users to their professional identity as a mechanism to encourage them to provide credible information. For this reason, on user profiles, we also display a blue tick mark. After usability testing, we added copy to inform users why we require them to log in using LinkedIn and what we do with their data. <br/><br/> <img src="img/portfolio/yckl.png" class="img-responsive img-centered img-border" alt=""><br/> The main view is different questions asked by community members. The main UI elements are highlighted. The +1 Button is another feature that promotes credibility. It tells users that their peers have the same question. This also motivates answer providers to answer high demand questions. <br/><br/> <img src="img/portfolio/yckl1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered img-border" alt=""> <br/>When a user clicks on a question, they see the individual question and answers. Feedback button is also important for promoting credibility. It shows the number of users who found an answer helpful. <br/><br/> <img src="img/portfolio/yckl2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered img-border" alt=""> <br/>The user can add their own answer here. We added a small line (the "no edit hack" above) to promote more mindfulness while answering. <br/><br/> <img src="img/portfolio/yckl3.png" class="img-responsive img-centered img-border" alt=""><br/> If a user clicks on the ask button on the home page they see this screen. We kept this page very simple to avoid distractions. <br/><br/> 
<b>Improving the Product</b><br/>I carried out user research (interviews, usability testing, card sort) to identify short term fixes and long term improvements. I also manually emailed our users to simulate notifications and ensure that they were engaged. <br/><br/>
<b>Branding</b><br/>I also designed a logo. The Y is designed to resemble the flux capacitor from Back to the Future. This was a conscious choice to emphasize the aspirations of the product and as a delightful element for keen users. Indeed, a few users who spotted the resemblance were happily surprised. <br/><br/><img src="img/portfolio/yacklelogo.png" class="img-responsive img-centered"> <br/><br/> 
<b>Roadmap</b><br/>Insights from the summative research I conducted help us prioritize the items on our roadmap. Eg. We found out that we need to Improve Discovery [by providing Search or other Discovery mechanism], Improve Engagement [using Automated Notifications, Feeds], allow users to target questions at subject matter experts. For the long term, we want to drive wider adoption and scale the system to handle several communities. <br/><br/> If you are a member of the Berkeley I School community, I would encourage you to sign up at <a href="http://yackle.co" target="_blank">Yackle</a> and give us feedback. <br/><br/>
<b>To Summarize</b><br/> In my career, I look forward to owning experiences for products. This was a great experience working on a product end to end and being responsible not just for the user experience but also for the overall decision making process. <br/><br/>
